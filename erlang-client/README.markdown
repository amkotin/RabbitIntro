erlang RabbitMQ client
======================

in the /src directory is a erabbit.erl you can use it as an easy to use
interface to rabbitmq from erlang. make sure you have all the incudes
linked for compile and all e=the ebin directories in the erlang load
path.

look into writer.erl and dumper.erl for a minimal howto use
documentation. you have to read the source - no nice doc included yet.
